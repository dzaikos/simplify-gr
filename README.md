Simplify GR

Designed for [Google Reader](https://reader.google.com/), Simplify GR integrates tools such as [Helvetireader](http://www.helvetireader.com/) and [FancyBox](http://www.fancybox.net/) to provide a clean, minimalistic reading experience.

The Simplify GR extension utilizes Helvetireader to reduce the clutter of the Google Reader interface by limiting the number of colours, buttons and social features normally presentâ€”some other stylesheet options are available as of Simplify GR version 1.2. When reading articles in Google Reader some entries contain the entire article, while others do not, requiring you to visit the originating website. Simplify GR makes this process more seamless by opening the originating website in an clean panel that floats overtop of the Google Reader page. This panel allows you to read an article and return to Google Reader in an incredibly seamless fashion. Simplify GR takes its seamlessness even further by opening full articles loaded within this floating panel through [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/)'s text view--providing a distraction-free reading experience similar to Safari 5's [Reader](http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#reader) mode.

All of these options are configurable within Safari 5's Preference Extensions pane. You can enable/disable Helvetireader (or other stylesheets) as well as enable/disable FancyBox or adjust how it works.

The full articles can be loaded in FancyBox by selecting the article in Google Reader to expand it, then either clicking the main title link or pressing the b key. Holding the Alt key while clicking the title link or pressing b will toggle Instapaper text view and the original web page.
